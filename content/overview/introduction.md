## What is thingiverseIO?

Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is
a static site generator. Unlike other systems which dynamically build a page
every time a visitor requests one, Hugo does the building when you create
your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are
edited, Hugo is optimized for website viewing while providing a great
writing experience.
